$ PHRASES.log holds your phrases.
$ EMOJI.log holds your emoji list.
$ NICKNAMES.log (optional) holds nicknames you tuck alongside phrases.

$ please use double quotes and commas as separators as per below, or you might break the lexer.
$ if several entries are on the same line, ONE of them will be picked at random.
$ weights can be used: place "3:" infront of a phrase line to make it three times as likely to appear.
$   the default weight is 1, a weight of 0 will naturally remove the entry from possibilities
$   weights are expected to be integers, that is positive numbers without a point (e.g. use 3 and not 2.5)
$ # TODO if there are several PHRASES.log, concatenate their contents
