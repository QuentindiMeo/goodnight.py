-- This is a tutorial contents source file.
-- It is not meant to be used as-is, but rather to be read and understood.
-- You can copy it as your own source file and modify it to your liking.
-- Note that source files are expected to have a .log extension.
-- You can use "--" at the beginning of a line as a comment trigger; empty lines are also ignored.

-- Sections
--   Three sections exist, each of them starting with the marker "## "
--   PHRASES.log holds your phrases.
--   EMOJI.log holds your emoji list. (needed if the --emoji parameter is set to true)
--   NICKNAMES.log holds nicknames you tuck alongside phrases. (optional)
--   The sections are meant to keep that exact format and naming, so be careful.
--   If there are several occurrences of a section, you will be asked if you want to concatenate
--     their contents or keep the first occurrence of the section only.

-- Notes
--   The order of the sections is not important.
--   Unlike in preferences files, comments will not be lost upon use of this file.
--   Use double quotes as delimiters, and commas as separators between entries, or you might break the lexical analyzer.
--   If several entries are on the same line, ONE of them will be picked at random.
--   You can put a weight on a phrase line: place "3:" in front of it to make it three times as likely to appear.
--     The default weight is 1, and a weight of 0 will ignore the entry.
--     Weights are expected to be integers (i.e., use 3 and not 2.5 or 3.7).
