$ please use double quotes and commas as separators as per below, or you might break the lexer.
$ if several entries are on the same line, ONE of them will be picked at random.
$ if there are several PHRASES.log (or other), you will be asked if you want to concatenate their contents or keep the first one only.
$ weights can be used: place "3:" infront of a phrase line to make it three times as likely to appear.
$   the default weight is 1, a weight of 0 will naturally remove the entry from possibilities
$   weights are expected to be integers, that is positive numbers without a point (e.g. use 3 and not 2.5)
