-- PHRASES.log holds your phrases.
-- EMOJI.log holds your emoji list. (needed if parameter is set)
-- NICKNAMES.log holds nicknames you tuck alongside phrases. (optional)
--
-- use double quotes and commas as separators as per below, or you might break the lexer.
-- use "--" at the beginning of a line as a comment trigger; empty lines are also ignored.
-- if several entries are on the same line, ONE of them will be picked at random.
-- if there are several PHRASES.log (or any other section header), you will be asked if you want to
--   concatenate their contents or keep the first occurrence of the section only.
-- weights can be used: place "3:" infront of a phrase line to make it three times as likely to appear.
--   the default weight is 1, a weight of 0 will remove the entry from possibilities.
--   weights are expected to be integers, that is positive numbers without a point (e.g. use 3 and not 2.5).
