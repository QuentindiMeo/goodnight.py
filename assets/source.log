-- This is a tutorial contents source file.
-- It is not meant to be used as-is, but rather to be read and understood.
-- You can copy it to your own source file and modify it to your liking.
-- Note that source files are meant to have a .log extension.

-- PHRASES.log holds your phrases.
-- EMOJI.log holds your emoji list. (needed if the --emoji parameter is set to True)
-- NICKNAMES.log holds nicknames you tuck alongside phrases. (optional)

-- Use double quotes and commas as separators as per below, or you might break the lexer.
-- You can use "--" at the beginning of a line as a comment trigger; empty lines are also ignored.
-- If several entries are on the same line, ONE of them will be picked at random.
-- If there are several occurrences of a header (e.g. PHRASES.log), you will be asked if you want to
--   concatenate their contents or keep the first occurrence of the section only.
-- Weights can be used: place "3:" infront of a phrase line to make it three times as likely to appear.
--   The default weight is 1, a weight of 0 will remove the entry from possibilities.
--   Weights are expected to be integers, that is positive numbers without a point (e.g. use 3 and not 2.5).
